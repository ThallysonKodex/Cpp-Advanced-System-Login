# Cpp-Advanced-System-Login
This is  a advanced login system i made in c++ to help beginner understand more about filehandling.  You can create an account and login it , this project also can detect that you typed the password or username wrong  or true and notice it to you. The data is auto update so when you exit the console windown, the data is still there, that mean if you open the windown console, you can login to the account that you created before.  The project is open source so you can download and see the code of it.  
Programed By LML STUDIO. You can use my code without credit but I'll appreciate if you do.
